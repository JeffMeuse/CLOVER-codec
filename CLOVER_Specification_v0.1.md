README
CLOVER is an open voice codec designed to deliver real-time speech comprehension using ultra-low bandwidth, local synthesis, and meaning-first encoding. It is built for individuals with auditory processing disorders, language barriers, and cognitive load challenges—where comprehension matters more than fidelity.

This repository provides the public domain specification for CLOVER, released under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0 1.0) license to guarantee free and unrestricted use.

Use it, build on it, share it. No royalties. No restrictions. Just clarity.

Introduction
CLOVER is a low-bandwidth, real-time voice encoding strategy designed for one purpose: to maximize comprehension—not fidelity. While traditional codecs chase high-resolution audio for music and entertainment, CLOVER targets human understanding, especially for individuals with cognitive, auditory, or linguistic challenges.

Where most codec development is driven by media quality and data density, CLOVER is built around the neuroscience of language processing, delay minimization, and interpretation readiness. It assumes a receiver who needs clarity—not perfection.

Purpose
CLOVER exists to serve populations overlooked by mainstream audio engineering:
- People with Auditory Processing Disorder (APD)
- The hearing-impaired
- Elderly users
- Neurodivergent users
- Second-language speakers
- Environments with cognitive overload, such as high-stakes phone calls, scam mitigation, and multilingual business exchange

CLOVER is not a product. It is a public codec architecture designed to restore comprehension as a natural right.

Core Design Principles
1. Meaning over waveform – CLOVER transmits intent using text-based or semantic compression rather than waveform preservation.
2. Ultra-low latency – Optimized for speed of understanding, not signal fidelity.
3. Local voice synthesis – Final audio is generated on-device using offline or embedded TTS libraries.
4. Bandwidth minimalism – Operates in sub-kilobyte payloads, significantly below traditional codec demand.
5. No DRM, no royalties – CLOVER is royalty-free, patent-unencumbered, and committed to accessibility.

Architecture Overview
- Input: Spoken language captured in real time or from a recorded source
- Processing:
  - Speech-to-text (STT)
  - Text reduction (semantic interpretation)
  - Intent modeling
- Output:
  - Optimized text payload (~<2kb per message)
  - Sent to receiver’s local text-to-speech system

Technical Goals
- < 50ms round-trip latency
- < 2kb transmission per message segment
- Text-based transmission resilient to packet loss and jitter
- Works over BLE, classic Bluetooth, IP-based transport, or low-power mesh
- Compatible with on-device AI interpretation and prioritization

Accessibility Commitment
CLOVER is engineered as a public service codec—analogous to public fonts, emergency tones, or accessibility ramps. It is not designed for profit, but for human parity in environments where speech is critical but misunderstood.

CLOVER will remain unowned, open, and free to implement. It can coexist with other codecs in device firmware or OS-level voice routing systems. No special hardware is required.

Academic Framing
CLOVER aligns with research in cognitive load theory, compressed natural language processing, and latency-sensitive communication strategies. It is designed for the real-world edge cases often excluded from controlled audio studies. It rejects audiophile elitism in favor of neurodivergent usability.

It is inspired by how humans naturally paraphrase, how captioners summarize for clarity, and how caregivers rephrase for accessibility. In essence, CLOVER is not audio technology. It is comprehension architecture.

Closing Declaration
The creators of this specification waive all rights and claims to this work. CLOVER belongs to everyone who ever struggled to hear, understand, or keep up.

This specification is not the end of a conversation. It’s the beginning of comprehension—for all.

Respectfully released to the public domain.
